**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N*log2(k))$

## Abstract

We have to find the kth (<=2*10^9) ancestor of a node in a functional graph (Each node having one parent only except root node obviously)

## Solution

Well, the naive method of traversing k times will result in TLE because k<=2x10^9. Another, method of finding all cycles in graph and then using cycles' path length also resulting in TLE.
Here, we use Binary Jumping. We pre-calculating the ancestor of each node after taking steps in powers of two. So, ancestor(x,i) gives the value of 2^i th ancestor of x. The recursive relation is ancestor(x,i)=ancestor( ancestor(x, i-1), i-1 ).
This process can be done in a nested loop having big-O Time complexity of n*log(k).

After this, for each query, we just need log(k) steps to look in ancestor-table and get the value when jump size reduces to 0. First we will jump the biggest [log(k)] (where [.] is floor function or integer part), and update k=k-jumpSize.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define loop(i, a, n) for(int i = a; i < n; ++i)

using namespace std;

int adj[200001];
int ancestor[200001][33];   //33>log2(2x10^9)

int main()
{
    int n, q;
    scanf("%d %d", & n, & q);
    loop(i,1,n+1)
    {
        scanf("%d",&adj[i]);
    }

    loop(i,1,n+1)
        ancestor[i][0]=adj[i];
    loop(i,1,33)
    {
        loop(j,1,n+1)
        {
            ancestor[j][i]=ancestor[ ancestor[j][i-1] ][i-1];
        }
    }

    while(q--)
    {
        int k;
        int start;
        cin>>start>>k;

        long long jump;

        int ans=start;

        while(k)
        {
            jump=log2(k);
            ans=ancestor[ans][jump];
            k-=(1<<jump);
        }

        cout<<ans<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}


```
